// Q40: Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing 
// a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and 
// it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information. Use the function 
// to make three dictionaries representing different albums. Print each return value to 
// show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. Add an optional parameter 
// to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. If the calling 
// line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. 
// Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.

function make_album(artist: string, title: string, tracks?: number): any { // Parameter "tracks" is optional Can be Given or Can't Given
    let album: any = {
      artist: artist,
      title: title,
};
    if (tracks !== undefined) {
        album.tracks = tracks;
    }
    return album;
};
  
// Creating albums with and without track counts
let album1 = make_album("Sidhu Moose Wala", "Moose Tape");
let album2 = make_album("Garry Sandhu", "Minna Minna");
let album3 = make_album("Karan Aujla", "On Top", 12);
  
console.log(album1);
console.log(album2);
console.log(album3);
