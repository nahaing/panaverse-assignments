// Q6: Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters 
// at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character 
// combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the 
// whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
var personName = "\t Usman \n";
console.log("Name With Whitespaces: ", personName);
console.log("Name Without Whitespaces: ", personName.trim());
