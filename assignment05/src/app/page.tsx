          The internet is without a doubt the most important technological
          development in human history. Web3 and metaverse technologies expand the
          internet as we know it by introducing novel features and advancements.
          Metaverse will make use of all aspects of modern technology, including 3D,
          VR, AR, AI, blockchain, cloud computing, voice computing, ambient
          computing, and more.

          Note: For AWS Free Tier you will need a credit or debit card. The easiest
          way for Pakistani students is to open a bank account with Meezan Bank.
          Open a Meezan Aasan Account if you have no earning proof. Meezan Bank will
          charge Rs. 1100 for ATM Debit Card and there is a requirement of Rs. 100
          minimum deposit. The card will be delivered in a few weeks. Our students
          have reported that this Debit card works with AWS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now you can create a virtual VISA Debit card through the NayaPay app
          (https://www.nayapay.com/ ) which can be used to create AWS/GCP/Azure
          accounts. This is good news for those students who find it difficult to
          create physical debit and credit cards from banks.

          booming, and it’s completely reinventing the way new startups kickstart

          crowdfunding projects
          https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-funded_crowdfunding_projects,

        </p>
        <p>Project Part 3: Create a Pako Token</p>
        <p>
          By creating a token and related contracts, you’ll also learn how to handle
          money sent to your contracts, which should come in handy if you want to
          create some kind of paid decentralized service in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, for the sake of this chapter, let’s imagine that our Pako DApp
          uses its own coin – the Pako Token. We will create two contracts – one for
          the token itself and one for the token crowd sale (the ICO).
        </p>
        <p>
          Now Create your own Pako ERC20 Token and deploy it on a testnet. The Token
          should be to use OpenZeppelin contracts. You will use the Hardhat
          development environment. Also, write at least twenty automated tests. We
          will be using Solidity and Typescript for development.
        </p>
        <p>Project Part 4: Develop Crowd Sale Contract</p>
        <p>
          This contract will be responsible for allowing users to exchange ETH for
          our Pako Token. In order to do that we need to set a price for our token
          (1 ETH = 100 Pako Token)
        </p>
        <p>Implement a payable buyToken() function.</p>
        <p>
          Emit a BuyTokens event that will log who’s the buyer, the amount of ETH
          sent and the amount of Token bought
        </p>
        <p>
          Transfer 75% of the Tokens to the Crowd Sale contract at deployment time.
          i.e. Right after the contract is deployed, we want the token contract to
          send 75% of our token supply to it. While 25% remain in our personal
          “owner” account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transfer the ownership of the Crowd Sale contract (at deploy time) to our
          frontend address so that we are able to withdraw the ETH.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use the openzeppelin crowd sale contracts
          https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/crowdsales however you will
          have to update the code to the latest solidity version.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also write extensive tests, for example we will simply send a transaction
          of 1 ETH from a random account to the contract. After the transaction, we
          should expect the account to have received Pako, while the contract’s
          balance should have been reduced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: Before you get started writing the token contract we suggest you
          review access control
          https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control
        </p>
        <p>Project Part 5: Trying it with MetaMask</p>
        <p>
          While it’s always good to test your code, it’s often more satisfying to
          see the results of your work wrapped in a nice UI. Let’s see how we can
          deploy our contracts and get some Pako tokens into our MetaMask wallet!
        </p>
        <p>
          We start by running our deployment scripts for the test network so that
          the new token contracts are uploaded and deployed.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it’s done, take note of what addresses the contracts were uploaded to
          and copy it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now head to MetaMask, and send a transaction of 1 ETH to the crowd sale
          contract address. If your MetaMask wallet doesn’t have any ethers,
          remember that you can use any faucet.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the transaction has been confirmed, you might be confused about why
          you can’t see any tokens in your wallet. It turns out that you need to
          manually add the token address in MetaMask in order to “register” it –
          after all, there are so many tokens out there, there’s no way MetaMask
          could list them all by default!
        </p>
        <p>
          To do this, open the side menu and click on the “Add token” button to get
          started:
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you’re on the token page, click on “Add custom token” and paste in
          the token contract’s address in the address field.
        </p>
        <p>
          After confirming that you want to add the token, you should be able to see
          your Pako balance right next to your ETH balance in the wallet. How cool!

          MV-361: Developing Planet-Scale Open Virtual and Augmented Metaverse
          Experiences

        <p>Duration: 13 Weeks</p>
        <p>Course Description:</p>
        <p>
          The Web is the Metaverse. The metaverse requires an infrastructure that
          connects all of the metaverses so that we can travel between them. This is
          only achievable with open web-based metaverses. The internet and its
          browsers are magical. Federated but linked experiences connect pages,
          people, technology, businesses, standards, and nations. It’s unlike
          anything else. The metaverse should replicate the best qualities of the
          web - it should just be the web. We just have to extend online responsive
          design from mobile to desktop to 3D, Augmented Reality, and Virtual
          Reality. This course will teach you how to build the Open Social Spatial
          Web with WebXR and WebGPU technologies.

        <p>Blender 3D asset Creation for the Metaverse (Remote Zoom Class)</p>
        <p>
          Blender development is being funded by heavyweights in the real-time 3D
          (RT3D) space such as Apple, Unity, AMD, Intel, Meta, NVIDIA, AWS, Epic
          Games, Adobe, Microsoft, and Decentraland. It is expected to become the
          standard asset creation tool for metaverse.
